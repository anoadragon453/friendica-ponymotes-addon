# Friendica Ponymotes Addon

Ponymote addons for Friendica. The `ponymotes_nsfw` folder contains ponymotes marked as #nsfw, #questionable and #nonpony.

## Install

To install, simply copy the `ponymotes` and `ponymotes_nsfw` folder (if you want NSFW emotes) to the `/addon` directory of your Friendica installation.

Once installed, you will need to activate the addon in the Admin Panel. Addons not activated have no effect on your node.

## TODO

- [ ] Per-user enablement of normal/NSFW ponymotes
- [ ] Admin panel default settings of normal/NSFW ponymotes
- [ ] Admin panel option to lock settings for users

Addon originally made for [https://ponies.im](https://ponies.im/community).
